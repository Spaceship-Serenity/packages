# DSS Setup & Config

## Creating code env without internet

Code envs will use "pip install -r requirements.txt" with a requirements.txt made of the packages you requested.

By design, code envs will never try to reuse packages that are already installed at the system level (what you did with your wheel install), since the goal of code envs in DSS is to provide isolated environments.

You can add custom options to the pip command line by going into the code env settings, unchecking "use global settings", and adding command line options. From the doc of pip, you should be able to install from your wheel by adding the following options:

--no-index
--find-links=/datadrive/data_dir/code-envs/packages/python/packages

## Running shell commands from notebooks

## Downloading files from the web


## Using git

## Plugin Setup

### Google sheets

This has a custom python code env running python 2.7 or 36
Requirements are:
pandas==0.20.3
pyOpenSSL
gspread==3.3.1
oauth2client==4.1.3
python-slugify==4.0.0

## Using Jupyter Widgets

#### Setup

Support for widgets needs to be enabled globally in the DSS Jupyter notebook by an administrator
Go to the DSS data directory and run the following commands

```
cd /datadrive/data_dir && \
JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR="/datadrive/data_dir/jupyter-run/jupyter" JUPYTER_DATA_DIR="/datadrive/data_dir/jupyter-run/jupyter" PYTHONPATH=/datadrive/dataiku-dss-5.1.6/dku-jupyter/packages ./bin/python -m notebook.nbextensions install --py widgetsnbextension --user
```


```
cd /datadrive/data_dir && \
JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR="/datadrive/data_dir/jupyter-run/jupyter" JUPYTER_DATA_DIR="/datadrive/data_dir/jupyter-run/jupyter" PYTHONPATH=/datadrive/dataiku-dss-5.1.6/dku-jupyter/packages ./bin/python -m notebook.nbextensions enable --py widgetsnbextension
```

```
echo export 'JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR="$DIP_HOME/jupyter-run/jupyter"' >> /datadrive/data_dir/bin/env-site.sh
```

and now just restart DSS

#### Using widgets

Open a new notebook, and enter sample widget code:

Note
If you are using a custom code env, donâ€™t forget to included the ipywidgets package in your code env

import ipywidgets

ipywidgets.IntSlider()
A slider should appear. You can now use ipywidgets.
